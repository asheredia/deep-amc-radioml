# RadioML-Classifier
 
This is a Deep learning benchmark for **Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC)** on the [RadioML 2018.01A](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pinxau1000/radioml2018) dataset (`GOLD_XYZ_OSC.0001_1024.hdf5`). Six architectures are evaluated and compared: from CNN and LSTM architectures to a patch-based Transformer, sharing the same modular codebase.
 
## Overview
 
The aim of Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) is to identify the modulation scheme of a received radio signal directly from raw In-phase and Quadrature (I/Q) samples, without prior knowledge of transmission parameters. It is a key component in cognitive radio, spectrum monitoring, and signal intelligence systems.
 
This repository benchmarks six deep learning architectures on RadioML 2018.01A (from DeepSig), a standard AMC benchmark covering 24 modulation types across a wide SNR range (−20 to +30 dB), analyzing the trade-off between classification accuracy and computational efficiency.

## Models
 
### Transformer
 
A patch-based Transformer encoder applied directly to raw I/Q sequences, inspired by Vision Transformers (ViT).
 
| Stage | Detail |
|---|---|
| Input | (1024, 2) |
| Patching | 64 patches × 32-dimensional tokens (patch size = 16 samples × 2 channels) |
| Projection | Linear projection to d_model = 128 |
| Positional encoding | Fixed sinusoidal encoding added to tokens |
| Encoder blocks | 2 × TransformerBlock (8 attention heads, FFN dim = 256) |
| Pooling | GlobalAveragePooling1D |
| Head | LayerNorm → Dense(128, SELU) → Dropout(0.2) → Dense(24, softmax) |
| **Total params** | **289K** |
 
### ResNet1D
 
A deep residual network operating directly on raw 1D I/Q signals. The number of stacks is derived automatically from the input length as `stacks = log2(1024) = 10`, halving the temporal dimension at each stage until it collapses to 1 before the head.
 
**Residual stack** (repeated × 10):
 
| Layer | Detail |
|---|---|
| Conv1D 1×1 | filters = 32, linear — channel projection |
| Residual unit 1 | Conv1D(3) ReLU → Conv1D(3) linear → Add (skip) |
| Residual unit 2 | Conv1D(3) ReLU → Conv1D(3) linear → Add (skip) |
| MaxPooling1D | pool = 2 → sequence length ÷ 2 |
 
**Head:** Flatten → Dense(128, SELU) → Dropout(0.5) → Dense(128, SELU) → Dropout(0.5) → Dense(24, softmax)
 
| **Total params** | **158K** |
|---|---|
 
### Baselines
 
| Model | Architecture | Params |
|---|---|---|
| **CNN** | 3 × [Conv1D → BN → MaxPool] → GAP → Dense(128) → Dense(24) | 161K |
| **CNN+LSTM** | 3 × [Conv1D → MaxPool] → 2 × LSTM → Dense(128) → Dense(24) | 267K |
| **LSTM** | 3 × LSTM(128/128/64) → Dense(128) → Dense(24) | 259K |
| **CNN+GRU** | 2 × [Conv1D → BN → MaxPool] → 2 × GRU → Dense(128) → Dense(24) | 174K |
 
---
 
## Training
 
All models follow the same training protocol:
 
- **Batch size:** 256
- **Epochs:** 100 with ReduceLROnPlateau
- **LR selection:** grid search over `[1e-4, 3e-4, 1e-3, 3e-3]` (3 epochs/trial) — optimal: `1e-3`
- **Loss:** Categorical cross-entropy
- **Optimizer:** Adam
- **Seed:** 2026

## Results
 
### Efficiency Comparison
 
| Model | Params | MFLOPs | Latency (ms) | Throughput (samples/s) | Recurrent |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CNN | 161K | 77.17 | 0.77 | 1294 | No |
| CNN+LSTM | 267K | 118.48 | 4.45 | 225 | Yes |
| LSTM | 259K | 252.70 | 28.20 | 35 | Yes |
| CNN+GRU | 174K | 88.86 | 7.65 | 131 | Yes |
| ResNet1D | 158K | 53.07 | 2.88 | 347 | No |
| **Transformer** | **289K** | **34.98** | **1.48** | **671** | **No** |
 
> The Transformer achieves the lowest MFLOPs and second-highest throughput despite having the most parameters. It is a direct consequence of its non-recurrent and fully parallelizable architecture.
 
### Overall Test Accuracy (all SNRs)
 
| Model | Overall Accuracy |
|---|---|
| LSTM | 65.8% |
| CNN+GRU | 63.5% |
| CNN+LSTM | 63.3% |
| ResNet1D | 61.7% |
| Transformer | 59.2% |
| CNN | 57.9% |
 
> Overall accuracy is averaged across the full SNR range (−20 to +30 dB), heavily weighted by the low-SNR regime where all models perform similarly.

### Key Findings
 
**At low SNR (≤ −6 dB):** all models converge to similar accuracy (~4–28%). The classification problem is dominated by noise and architecture choice has minimal impact.
 
**In the transition region (−4 to +6 dB):** LSTM-based models pull ahead, benefiting from explicit sequential modeling of inter-symbol dependencies. The gap widens significantly above 0 dB.
 
**At high SNR (≥ +10 dB):** LSTM, CNN+LSTM, CNN+GRU and ResNet1D saturate around 96–97%. The CNN and Transformer plateau at ~91% — the Transformer's patch-based tokenization fragments inter-symbol phase transitions, limiting discrimination of high-order PSK schemes (16PSK, 32PSK).
 
**Efficiency vs. accuracy trade-off:** The Transformer offers the best accuracy/compute ratio for latency-constrained scenarios (1.48 ms, 671 samples/s, 34.98 MFLOPs). LSTM achieves the highest accuracy but at 28.2 ms latency (19× slower than the Transformer) making it unsuitable for real-time deployment.
 
### Persistent Confusion Patterns
 
Across all models and SNR levels:
 
- **AM-DSB-WC ↔ AM-DSB-SC** — the hardest pair; time-domain similarity makes them nearly indistinguishable under noise
- **High-order QAM (128–256QAM)** — constellation density causes overlap at moderate SNR
- **8PSK ↔ 16PSK / 32PSK** — phase boundary ambiguity, more pronounced in the Transformer due to patch-based tokenization

## Limitations
 
- Performance drops significantly below 0 dB SNR across all architectures
- Models are trained and evaluated on RadioML 2018.01A, where each example 
  is generated with independently drawn random channel parameters (frequency 
  offset, phase noise, SNR, etc.). Generalization to real-world hardware 
  impairments beyond those modeled in the dataset is not guaranteed.
